*Predicting Amazon Stock Closing Price using Deep Learning*

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:
This project focuses on predicting the closing price of Amazon (AMZN) stock using Deep Learning techniques. The stock market is highly volatile, and accurate predictions can assist investors in making informed
decisions. By leveraging deep learning, this project aims to identify patterns in historical stock prices and provide reliable forecasts.

ðŸš€ Key Features:
Utilizes historical stock data for training the model
Data preprocessing and visualization using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
Model evaluation using appropriate metrics like MSE (Mean Squared Error)
Future price predictions based on trained deep learning models

File Structure:
Amazon_Stock_Prediction_Model.py - Main Python script for taking inputs and making predictions.
Stock_DEEPlearning.ipynb- Main Jupyter file in which model is trained.
Deep_learning_Stock_Prediction1.pkl - File in which model is saved by joblib lib.
StandardScaler1.pkl - Scaler used to standardize input features.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset:
The dataset consists of Amazon's historical stock prices, including Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and other features. 
The data is preprocessed to ensure quality predictions by handling missing value, normalization, and feature engineering.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used:
Python: Programming Language
TensorFlow & Keras: Deep Learning Frameworks
Pandas & NumPy: Data Handling and Preprocessing
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data Visualization
Scikit-learn: Data Scaling and Model Evaluation

ðŸ“ˆ Results & Analysis:
The model successfully identifies trends in Amazon's stock prices.
Predictions show promising results, aligning closely with actual stock movements.
Further improvements can be made by fine-tuning hyperparameters and incorporating external factors like market news and sentiment analysis.

ðŸ”— How to Use:
Install dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed and run the following command:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn
Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open the provided .ipynb file and execute the cells step by step.
Analyze the results: Visualizations and predictions will be generated as outputs.

ðŸ“Œ Future Enhancements:
Integrating real-time stock market data for dynamic predictions.
Implementing attention mechanisms to improve model accuracy.
Exploring additional deep learning architectures like CNN-LSTM hybrids.
